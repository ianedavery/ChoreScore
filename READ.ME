When a user clicks on 'redeem' they are asked what family memeber wants to redeem the badge. --> The points accrued value of the family member is compared against the cost of the badge --> if the cost of the badge is equal to, or less than, the cost of the badge, the cost is deducted from the family member's points accrued 

1. add event listener to 'redeem' button
2. create variable for the cost of the badge
